# Phase 2: Upload Pipeline - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Users can upload, preview, and download images without AI. This phase proves file handling works: drag-and-drop, click-to-browse, format validation, preview display, and download flow. Transformation is Phase 4.

## Implementation Decisions

### Upload interaction
- Full-page drop target — entire viewport accepts file drops
- Centered button in drop zone for click-to-browse
- Minimal copy — upload icon only, possibly file types, no instructional text

### Claude's Discretion
- Drag-over visual feedback style (border highlight, overlay, tint, etc.)
- Preview display sizing and layout
- Validation error presentation
- Progress indicator design
- Empty state styling

## Specific Ideas

No specific requirements — open to standard approaches. The cosmic theme from Phase 1 (dark mode default) should carry through.
