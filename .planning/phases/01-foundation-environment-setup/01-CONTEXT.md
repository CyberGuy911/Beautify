# Phase 1: Foundation & Environment Setup - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-21
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Establish secure infrastructure with API key protection and cost controls. Scaffold the base UI with dark/light mode toggle. This phase sets up the foundation before any image handling or AI integration.

## Implementation Decisions

### Visual Style & Color Palette
- Default theme: Dark (matches cosmic/mystical transformation vibe)
- Accent color: Gold/copper (warm, matches the golden highlights in transformations)
- Dark theme: Deep space black — true black (#000) or near-black, high contrast
- Light theme: Warm cream — soft off-white, warmer feel

### Page Layout Structure
- Responsive design that looks great on both desktop and mobile
- Modern and intuitive integration — Claude has discretion on specific layout approach
- Minimal footer (just credits or a link)

### Theme Toggle
- Icon style: Sun/moon icons (classic, universally understood)
- Persistence: Yes, save to localStorage
- Transition: Smooth fade between themes

### Claude's Discretion
- Specific layout structure (centered card vs full-width vs other)
- Content density and spacing
- Header/nav presence and style
- Toggle placement location
- Exact color values within the gold/copper and deep space black direction

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- The dark theme should evoke "deep space" — the cosmic backdrop of the transformations
- Gold/copper accent ties into the "warm golden and copper highlights" from the transformation prompt
- Light mode should feel warm and inviting, not clinical white
