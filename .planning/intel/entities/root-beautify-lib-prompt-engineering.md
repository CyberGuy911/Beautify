# prompt-engineering.ts

## Purpose

Generates the mystical cosmic portrait transformation prompt for Gemini image transformation. Follows Google's "describe the scene" best practice from their Nano Banana prompting guide.

## Exports

- `generateMysticalPrompt()`: Returns the transformation prompt string used for cosmic/mystical portrait generation

## Dependencies

None

## Used By

TBD

## Notes

- Currently returns an empty string - implementation appears incomplete
- Prompt engineering approach: uses descriptive language rather than keyword listing per Google's recommendations
